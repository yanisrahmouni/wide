# Patrimoine Survey Data Hub: Research Collaboration and Harmonization

Welcome to the **Patrimoine Survey Data Hub**, a collaborative repository designed to facilitate the harmonization and analysis of data from the French *Patrimoine* Survey on household wealth. This repository serves as a central platform for researchers working on various aspects of the survey, providing tools for data harmonization, contextual understanding, and support for international collaboration. It is part of the WIDE project, a research group primarily based at *Institut National d'Etudes Démographiques*, France, which focuses on studying the consequences of demographic events on individuals' wealth outcomes. Information about the project is found [here](https://wide.site.ined.fr/en/about/).

## The *Patrimoine* survey data

The Patrimoine survey aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the financial, professional, and property assets, as well as liabilities, of individuals and households in France. It allows for both cross-household comparisons and analyses of wealth distribution within households. Beyond core wealth measures, the survey gathers detailed information on familial and vocational histories, particularly focusing on inheritances, donations, and income profiles. Conducted every six years from 1986 to 2010, the survey shifted to a three-year interval thereafter. Since 2014, a portion of households have also contributed to longitudinal data.

The changes in survey design, along with shifts in French society, have led to variations in question formulation and data post-processing over time. These changes have introduced discrepancies in variable naming, coding, and integration into statistical software. Additionally, external variations arise from differing definitions of key concepts, such as wealth and household composition, which can vary among researchers depending on their methodologies and the accounting standards they follow. This hub aims to address both internal inconsistencies and these external conceptual variations, offering a resource for researchers and users seeking a standardized approach to analyzing the *Patrimoine* survey.

## Repository structure

This GitHub repository has three main objectives: 

- **Common definitions and methods:** When detailed information is lacking, researchers may need to make assumptions regarding wealth, such as its distribution within the household how it is computed. This repository is designed to list, compare, and facilitate discussions about these different assumptions, providing users with informed options for their own analyses.  

- **Harmonization tools:** The repository also includes a set of tools designed to help harmonize survey data across different years. When pooled together, users may encounter discrepancies such as different variable names for the same information, variations in categories due to changes in survey design, or shifts in categories reflecting societal changes in France (e.g., degree reforms). This repository serves as a place to document these changes and, ultimately, offers strategies to address and resolve these discrepancies for consistent analysis. 

- **Contextual documentation:** For international users or those unfamiliar with the French syste, this section offers detailed explanations of the French educational, financial, and institutional context, helping users accurately interpret the data. 

For confidentiality purposes, the original data is not included in this GitHub repository. The data can be downloaded via [Progedo](https://data.progedo.fr/studies/doi/10.13144/lil-1625) in a limited version, where certain confidential variables are unavailable. Full access to the data is provided through the [CASD](https://www.casd.eu/source/enquete-histoire-de-vie-et-patrimoine/). It is assumed that you have left the data untouched from the download, i.e., all files should have a zip format. An R script is provided to unzip those files and organize the data appropriately, allowing you to run the remaining R scripts available on the platform.

## Contributing

To contribute, users with access to the *Patrimoine* survey data who wish to participate in the shared codes and methodologies can contact Marion Leturcq at the following address: marion.leturcq@ined.fr. Additionally, to request the inclusion of a specific variable in the harmonization process, a dedicated flag has been set up in the "Issues" section within the "scripts" folder.
